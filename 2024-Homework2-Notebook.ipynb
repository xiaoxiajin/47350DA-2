    "The goal in this homework is to work with the data to build and evaluate prediction models that capture the relationship between the descriptive features and the target feature **DAMAGE**. For this homework you are asked to use the same dataset allocated to you in Homework1 (you can use your cleaned/prepared CSV from Homework1 or start from the raw dataset, clean it according to concepts covered in the lectures/labs, then use it for training prediction models). \n",

Threshold the predicted target feature value given by the linear regression model at 0.5, to get the predicted class for each example. Print the predicted class for the first 10 examples. Print a few classification evaluation measures computed on the full training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (2.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained on the training (70%) dataset. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset).

Is it more   accurate than a simple model that always predicts the majority class (i.e., if 'no' is the majority class in your dataset, the simple model always predicts 'no' for the target feature)? What is a good baseline for this task? Justify your answers.\n",
    "    - (5.2) Summarise your understanding of the problem and of your predictive modeling results so far. Can you think of any new ideas to improve the best model so far (e.g., by using furher data prep such as: feature selection, feature re-scaling, creating new features, combining predictive models, or using other domain knowledge)? Please show how your ideas actually work in practice (with code), by training and evaluating your proposed models. Summarise your findings so far. "

    "The values between continuous data are relatively low, indicating that the linear dependence between the continuous features is not strong. Perhaps the model construction needs to rely on nonlinear features or combined features to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the strong correlation between Longitude and Latitude:\n",
    "The two show a high negative correlation close to -0.89, which is a natural phenomenon in geographic coordinates, because the two usually change in opposite directions in actual geographic space. However, such strong correlations themselves may not have practical analytical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the correlation between Incident_Start_Year and Incident_Start_Month:\n",
    "The correlation between the two is as high as -0.88, indicating that there may be some structural tendency in the data set: for example, some years occur in certain months. It is worth further checking whether the data is concentrated in a certain time window or whether there is a bias in the data collection mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the moderate positive correlation between Year_Built_Known and Incident_Start_Year (0.72):\n",
    "This may indicate that the data records of new buildings are more complete or easier to match with accident information. This can be considered as a data bias feature when modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will analyze the relationship between these features and the target feature Damage_Binary to determine if they are useful for the predictive model.\n",

    "The single train/test split shows an accuracy of 78.7%, while the 3-fold cross-validation (CV) provides a slightly lower average accuracy of 78.1%. This small difference suggests that the model's performance is relatively stable across different data partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency Across Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both single train/test and CV produce very similar confusion matrices and classification reports. For instance, precision and recall values for class 1 (damage) are consistently high (precision ~0.83–0.84, recall ~0.70–0.72), indicating that the model reliably identifies damage when it occurs but still misses a certain portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-scores for both classes are also similar, hovering around 0.77–0.80, which confirms the model’s general balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The slight drop in performance on the CV results (especially class 1 recall from 0.72 to 0.70) may indicate minor overfitting on the original train/test split, though the difference is not alarming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation offers a more robust evaluation, as it simulates the model’s behavior on multiple unseen data subsets. The close alignment between the two results increases confidence in the model’s generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: The high similarity between the two evaluation methods suggests that the model is neither heavily overfitting nor underfitting. However, the consistent underperformance in recall for damaged structures (class 1) remains an area for improvement. Potential strategies include:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Worthy of further attention**\n",
    "\n",
    "The category Ignition_Resistant, which is expected to be protective, surprisingly shows a positive association with damage. This may indicate issues in how this category is defined or how it's being applied in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several \"unknown\" or \"other\" categories, such as in window type and roof construction, are among the higher-impact features. This suggests that data quality and completeness play a significant role in model prediction, and improving data labeling or cleaning could enhance model reliability."

    "Incident_Start_Year: Emerges as the top predictor, much more dominant than in linear/logistic models. Likely reflects certain years have more intense or frequent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Window_Pane_Grouped_Unknown: Consistently important across all models. Missing data about windows is strongly correlated with damage, making this feature a potential proxy for structural vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zip_Risk_Level_High: Geographic location is important— models consistently identify high-risk ZIP codes as strong predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exterior_Siding_Grouped_Other: Important again, though more dominant in regression models, it remains impactful in random-forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worthy of Further Attention**\n",
    "Ignition_Resistant Siding: Its significance is low and directionally inconsistent (positive in regression analysis), suggesting that it may be misleading or reflect confounding. Further examination of how this category is defined and distributed is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural type variables: These variables have a small effect in the random forest model, perhaps because the interactions captured by the tree model mask the effects of structural type alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest reveals more complex interactions, with time-based features (like Incident_Start_Year) becoming much more dominant. Tree-based models can capture non-linear temporal effects that linear/logistic models can’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge in regard of the Working of Random Forest Model**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. No standardization is needed for Incident_Start_Year in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linear and logistic regression models, the Random Forest model does not require standardization of continuous features such as Incident_Start_Year. This is because decision trees (the core component of Random Forest) split based on thresholds, not distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree in the forest decides where to split a continuous variable by evaluating the actual value and determining the best split point (e.g., \"Is the year ≤ 2021?\"). The magnitude or scale of the feature has no effect on the tree's decision process. Therefore, standardizing features such as Incident_Start_Year (i.e., converting it to zero mean and unit variance) is unnecessary and does not provide benefit to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also explains why Incident_Start_Year becomes the most important feature in the Random Forest model - its original scale and variability are directly and naturally exploited by the tree's splitting mechanism without any preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No manual thresholding required for random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key difference between random forests and models like logistic regression is that random forests automatically output discrete class predictions (0 or 1) when using `model.predict()`, without the need to manually set a classification threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because random forests are ensemble classifiers, which aggregate the predictions of multiple independent decision trees. Each tree makes a hard decision, and the final prediction is based on a majority vote across all decision trees. If more than 50% of the decision trees vote for class 1, the ensemble prediction is 1, otherwise it is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, models like logistic regression return probability scores, and the user must select a classification threshold to convert probabilities to class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we explicitly want the predicted probabilities, we use `model.predict_proba()`."
